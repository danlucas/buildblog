## What's this for?

* Personal site
* Holds blog rantings, code samples, general information about me

## How do we want it to look?

* text and code should be up front and center.  
* On entry I want the reader to be looking at content, not me or my design.

## So you'll need...

* Flexibility.  This isn't a blog so much so the generator shouldn't tie me to that format.
* And not much else, no need to make this more complicated than it needs to be.  We live in the age of continual updates.  Nothing need be set in stone.
