* Brand or Blog?

If the former then the front page can be a little more designed and splashy.  If the latter, then we need blog content up front. (A blog will live somewhere, regardless).

* Personal or Work related?

Will we have pictures? Unfiltered social feeds? Just code , ramblings and ideas?

* Who is the audience?

Well let's start here.  Is this just for me? (no). Employers (secondarily).  Is for anyone looking to find some info (yes)
