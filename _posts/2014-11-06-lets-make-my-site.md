title: "Let's make my site"
---

It's time to make a new personal site.  For fun this time.  Not to get a job or anything, but to have a place to play and maybe show off.  To write things longer than a tweet or maybe show you something I'm really excited about.  

Now I could just put up a jekyll blog (like this one) up and just call it a day, but that wouldn't be very exciting.  Instead I'm going to build a system that can fit my needs and hopefully will be flexible enough to deal with my whims.

With that in mind I wanted to document the process so I made this little blog to keep track of my decisions and to get the occasional feedback on my thoughts. And maybe it'll help someone out in the future.  Who knows? You can contact me via Twitter [@danlucas](http://www.twitter.com/danlucas).
