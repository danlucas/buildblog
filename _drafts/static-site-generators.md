title: "Static Site Generators"
---

My goodness, there are [a lot of static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) out there.  Pretty overwhelming in fact.  Let's consider a few things.

## Language
I'm a javascript guy so it probably makes sense to do something that's JavaScript based so I can hack on it easily.  Seems like [Hexo](http://hexo.io/) is pretty popular right now, but I know about Assemble and Harp...

Jekyll is pretty reliable and seems like the most mature thing around right now.  I even use it for this site.  I could even argue that I should use it because I need to start branching out to other languages anyway.

There's even some Python static site generators, if I want to get really crazy.

## Honestly
Would it just make more sense just to run everything through gulp?  [Create my own, personal static site generator](https://medium.com/objects-in-space/considering-a-static-site-tool-learn-gulp-2fd5f9821fc4)?

Or I could just throw up my hands and just use wordpress?
